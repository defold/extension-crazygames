Select `Project->Fetch Libraries` once you have added the version to `game.project` to download the version and make it available in your project.

# Usage


## Implement the gameplay events

Use the `crazygames.gameplay_start()` event to describe when users are playing your game (e.g. on first user interaction and unpause).

Use the `crazygames.gameplay_stop()` event to describe when users arenâ€™t playing your game (e.g. level finish, game over, pause, quit to menu).

```lua
-- first level loads, player clicks anywhere
crazygames.gameplay_start()
-- player is playing
-- player loses round
crazygames.gameplay_stop()
-- game over screen pops up
```


## Implement loading events

Use the `crazygames.loading_start()` and `crazygames.loading_stop()` events to track when and how long the loading of your game takes.

```lua
-- assets are loading
crazygames.loading_start()
-- assets are loaded
crazygames.loading_stop()
```


## Implement midgame ads

Midgame advertisements can happen when a user died, a level has been completed, etc. Do not show a midgame ad on a navigational button (e.g. when clicking the main menu icon or opening the settings or opening the shop). [Learn more about midgame ads on the official CrazyGames developer pages](https://docs.crazygames.com/requirements/ads/#requirements-for-midgame-ads).


```lua
crazygames.show_midgame_ad(function(self, result)
  if result then
    print("Midgame ad was successfully shown")
  else
    print("Request for midgame ad was unfilled")
  end
end)
```


## Implement rewarded ads

Rewarded advertisements can be requested by the user in exchange for a reward (An additional life, a retry when the user died, a bonus starting item, extra starting health, etc.). Rewarded ads should be shown when users explicitly consent to watch an advertisement. [Learn more about rewarded ads on the official CrazyGames developer pages](https://docs.crazygames.com/requirements/ads/#requirements-for-rewarded-ads).


```lua
crazygames.show_rewarded_ad(function(self, result)
  if result then
    print("Rewarded ad was successfully shown")
  else
    print("Rewarded ad was not shown due to an error")
  end
end)
```
